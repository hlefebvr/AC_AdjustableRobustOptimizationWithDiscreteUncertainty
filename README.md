# Adjustable Robust Optimization with discrete uncertainty

This repository contains instances and results used in the paper "Adjustable Robust Optimization with discrete uncertainty" by Lefebvre, et al. (2023).

We provide instances and results for the Facility Location Problem with random disruptions in side the FacilityLocationProblem folder. 
We provide instances for the Multiple Knapsack Problem with random weights in side the MultipleKnapsackProblem folder. 
A dedicated README file can be found with details on how to parse our data and interpret our results.
